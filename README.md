Netflix Data Analysis Project  

My First Data Science Project  
Welcome to my first Kaggle data science project! This project is a hands-on exploration of data analysis and visualization using Python.   

It represents my journey into the field of data science, where I apply data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques to extract insights from a dataset.

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset to uncover meaningful patterns and trends. 

The key objectives include:  
✔ Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, formatting inconsistencies, and optimizing data for analysis.  
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, distributions, and correlations in the dataset.  
✔ Data Visualization: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visual insights.
